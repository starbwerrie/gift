Merry Christmas, my dear fella.

I know it is not Christmas there yet, but it already is here where I am, and I could not wait any longer to reach out. Distance and time zones aside, you were one of the very first people I thought of this season. Something about this time of year makes you think about who truly mattered when life felt heavy, and I wanted to make sure you know how deeply grateful I am for you.

This year has been heavy in ways I never expected, and when I look back on everything I have been through, your presence stands out so clearly. You showed up for me not just in words, but through real care when I was struggling the most. You supported me emotionally, mentally, and even financially during moments when I did not know how I would get through things. You helped without judgment, without hesitation, and without ever making me feel small or ashamed. That kind of generosity and understanding is rare, and it touched my life in ways I will never be able to fully put into words.

More than the help itself, it was the consistency that meant everything to me. You were always there to listen, to check in, and to remind me that I was not alone. Even from miles away, your presence was steady and real. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and close to giving up, and your words and encouragement were what helped me breathe again and keep going. Distance never stopped you from showing up, and that alone speaks volumes about the kind of person you are.

I know I cannot help you financially in the same way you helped me, and sometimes that sits heavy on my heart. I wish I could give back in the same tangible way. But what you gave me went far beyond money. You gave me reassurance when I doubted myself. You gave me stability when everything felt uncertain. You gave me the strength to move forward during one of the most difficult periods of my life, and that is something I will always carry with me.

This Christmas, my gift to you is not something physical. It is my sincere gratitude, my deep respect, and my commitment to always show up for you the way you have shown up for me. It is my prayers for your peace, your happiness, and everything good you deserve. Your kindness has left a lasting impact on me, and it has changed the way I see support, loyalty, and generosity. I will always carry that lesson with me.

I also want you to know that I am truly hoping and praying for your healing. Knowing that you have been dealing with sickness has been heavy on my heart. It hurts to think of you going through that, and I genuinely hope you feel better very soon. I hope your strength returns, your body finds relief, and you feel comforted and cared for. You give so much of yourself to others, and you deserve health, peace, and rest more than you know.

Thank you for being genuine, generous, and dependable. Thank you for standing by me when things were hard. No matter the distance, please know that what you have done for me will never be forgotten and will always be appreciated.

Merry Christmas, from my heart to yours.
Always grateful.
